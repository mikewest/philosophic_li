    <h3>Preface</h3>

    <p id="p1">Ancient Greek philosophy was divided into three sciences:
    <strong>physics</strong>, <strong>ethics</strong>, and
    <strong>logic</strong>. This division is perfectly suitable to the nature
    of the thing; and the only improvement that can be made in it is to
    add the principle on which it is based, so that we may both satisfy
    ourselves of its completeness, and also be able to determine correctly
    the necessary subdivisions.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p2">All rational knowledge is either <em>material</em> or
    <em>formal</em>: the former considers some object, the latter is concerned
    only with the form of the understanding and of the reason itself, and with
    the universal laws of thought in general without distinction of its
    objects. Formal philosophy is called <strong>logic</strong>. Material
    philosophy, however, has to do with determinate objects and the laws to
    which they are subject, is again twofold; for these laws are either laws
    of <strong>nature</strong> or of <strong>freedom</strong>. The science of
    the former is <strong>physics</strong>, that of the latter,
    <strong>ethics</strong>; they are also called natural philosophy and moral
    philosophy respectively.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p3">Logic cannot have any empirical part; that is, a part in which
    the universal and necessary laws of thought should rest on grounds taken
    from experience; otherwise it would not be logic, i.e., a canon for the
    understanding or the reason, valid for all thought, and capable of
    demonstration. Natural and moral philosophy, on the contrary, can each
    have their empirical part, since the former has to determine the
    laws of nature as an object of experience; the latter the laws of
    the human will, so far as it is affected by nature: the former,
    however, being laws according to which everything does happen; the
    latter, laws according to which everything ought to happen. Ethics,
    however, must also consider the conditions under which what ought to
    happen frequently does not.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p4">We may call all philosophy <em>empirical</em>, so far as it is
    based on grounds of experience: on the other band, that which delivers its
    doctrines from <span class="translation" lang="la">a priori</span><a
    class="note" id="cite1" href="#note1">1</a> principles alone we may call
    <em>pure</em> philosophy. When the latter is merely formal it is
    <em>logic</em>; if it is restricted to definite objects of the
    understanding it is <em>metaphysic</em>.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>
    
    <p id="p5">In this way there arises the idea of a twofold metaphysic
    &mdash; a <em>metaphysic of nature</em> and a <em>metaphysic of
    morals</em>. Physics will thus have an empirical and also a rational part.
    It is the same with Ethics; but here the empirical part might have the
    special name of <em>practical anthropology</em>, the name
    <em>morality</em> being appropriated to the rational part.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p6">All trades, arts, and handiworks have gained by division of
    labour, namely, when, instead of one man doing everything, each
    confines himself to a certain kind of work distinct from others in the
    treatment it requires, so as to be able to perform it with greater
    facility and in the greatest perfection. Where the different kinds
    of work are not distinguished and divided, where everyone is a
    jack-of-all-trades, there manufactures remain still in the greatest
    barbarism. It might deserve to be considered whether pure philosophy
    in all its parts does not require a man specially devoted to it, and
    whether it would not be better for the whole business of science if
    those who, to please the tastes of the public, are wont to blend the
    rational and empirical elements together, mixed in all sorts of
    proportions unknown to themselves, and who call themselves independent
    thinkers, giving the name of minute philosophers to those who apply
    themselves to the rational part only &mdash; if these, I say, were warned
    not to carry on two employments together which differ widely in the
    treatment they demand, for each of which perhaps a special talent is
    required, and the combination of which in one person only produces
    bunglers. But I only ask here whether the nature of science does not
    require that we should always carefully separate the empirical from
    the rational part, and prefix to Physics proper (or empirical physics)
    a metaphysic of nature, and to practical anthropology a metaphysic
    of morals, which must be carefully cleared of everything empirical, so
    that we may know how much can be accomplished by pure reason in both
    cases, and from what sources it draws this its <span class="translation"
    lang="la">a priori</span> teaching, and that whether the latter inquiry is
    conducted by all moralists (whose name is legion), or only by some who
    feel a calling thereto.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p7">As my concern here is with moral philosophy, I limit the
    question suggested to this: Whether it is not of the utmost necessity to
    construct a pure thing which is only empirical and which belongs to
    anthropology? for that such a philosophy must be possible is evident
    from the common idea of duty and of the moral laws. Everyone must
    admit that if a law is to have moral force, i.e., to be the basis of
    an obligation, it must carry with it absolute necessity; that, for
    example, the precept, &#8220;Thou shalt not lie,&#8221; is not valid for
    men alone, as if other rational beings had no need to observe it; and so
    with all the other moral laws properly so called; that, therefore, the
    basis of obligation must not be sought in the nature of man, or in the
    circumstances in the world in which he is placed, but <span
    class="translation" lang="la">a priori</span> simply in the conception of
    pure reason; and although any other precept which is founded on principles
    of mere experience may be in certain respects universal, yet in as far as
    it rests even in the least degree on an empirical basis, perhaps only as
    to a motive, such a precept, while it may be a practical rule, can never
    be called a moral law.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p8">Thus not only are moral laws with their principles essentially
    distinguished from every other kind of practical knowledge in which
    there is anything empirical, but all moral philosophy rests wholly
    on its pure part. When applied to man, it does not borrow the least
    thing from the knowledge of man himself (anthropology), but gives laws
    <span class="translation" lang="la">a priori</span> to him as a rational
    being. No doubt these laws require a judgement sharpened by experience, in
    order on the one hand to distinguish in what cases they are applicable,
    and on the other to procure for them access to the will of the man and
    effectual influence on conduct; since man is acted on by so many
    inclinations that, though capable of the idea of a practical pure reason,
    he is not so easily able to make it effective <span class="translation"
    lang="la">in concreto</span> in his life.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p9">A metaphysic of morals is therefore indispensably necessary,
    not merely for speculative reasons, in order to investigate the sources of
    the practical principles which are to be found <span class="translation"
    lang="la">a priori</span> in our reason, but also because morals
    themselves are liable to all sorts of corruption, as long as we are
    without that clue and supreme canon by which to estimate them correctly.
    For in order that an action should be morally good, it is not enough that
    it <em>conform to</em> the moral law, but it must also be done <em>for the
    sake of the law</em>, otherwise that conformity is only very contingent
    and uncertain; since a principle which is not moral, although it may now
    and then produce actions conformable to the law, will also often produce
    actions which contradict it. Now it is only a pure philosophy that we can
    look for the moral law in its purity and genuineness (and, in a practical
    matter, this is of the utmost consequence): we must, therefore,
    begin with pure philosophy (metaphysic), and without it there cannot
    be any moral philosophy at all. That which mingles these pure
    principles with the empirical does not deserve the name of
    philosophy (for what distinguishes philosophy from common rational
    knowledge is that it treats in separate sciences what the latter
    only comprehends confusedly); much less does it deserve that of
    moral philosophy, since by this confusion it even spoils the purity of
    morals themselves, and counteracts its own end.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p10">Let it not be thought, however, that what is here demanded is
    already extant in the propaedeutic prefixed by the celebrated Wolf
    to his moral philosophy, namely, his so-called <em>general practical
    philosophy</em>, and that, therefore, we have not to strike into an
    entirely new field. Just because it was to be a general practical
    philosophy, it has not taken into consideration a will of any
    particular kind &mdash; say one which should be determined solely from a
    priori principles without any empirical motives, and which we might
    call a pure will, but volition in general, with all the actions and
    conditions which belong to it in this general signification. By this
    it is distinguished from a metaphysic of morals, just as general
    logic, which treats of the acts and canons of thought <em>in general</em>,
    is distinguished from transcendental philosophy, which treats of the
    particular acts and canons of pure thought, i.e., that whose
    cognitions are altogether <span class="translation" lang="la">a
    priori</span>. For the metaphysic of morals has to examine the idea and
    the principles of a possible <em>pure</em> will, and not the acts and
    conditions of human volition generally, which for the most part are drawn
    from psychology. It is true that moral laws and duty are spoken of in the
    general moral philosophy (contrary indeed to all fitness). But this is no
    objection, for in this respect also the authors of that science remain
    true to their idea of it; they do not distinguish the motives which are
    prescribed as such by reason alone altogether <span class="translation"
    lang="la">a priori</span>, and which are properly moral, from the
    empirical motives which the understanding raises to general conceptions
    merely by comparison of experiences; but, without noticing the difference
    of their sources, and looking on them all as homogeneous, they consider
    only their greater or less amount. It is in this way they frame their
    notion of <em>obligation</em>, which, though anything but moral, is all
    that can be attained in a philosophy which passes no judgement at all on
    the <em>origin</em> of all possible practical concepts, whether they are
    <span class="translation" lang="la">a priori</span>, or only
    <span class="translation" lang="la">a posteriori</span>.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p11">Intending to publish hereafter a metaphysic of morals, I issue
    in the first instance these fundamental principles. Indeed there is
    properly no other foundation for it than the critical examination of a
    <em>pure practical reason</em>; just as that of metaphysics is the
    critical examination of the pure speculative reason, already published. But
    in the first place the former is not so absolutely necessary as the
    latter, because in moral concerns human reason can easily be brought
    to a high degree of correctness and completeness, even in the
    commonest understanding, while on the contrary in its theoretic but
    pure use it is wholly dialectical; and in the second place if the
    critique of a pure practical reason is to be complete, it must be
    possible at the same time to show its identity with the speculative
    reason in a common principle, for it can ultimately be only one and
    the same reason which has to be distinguished merely in its
    application. I could not, however, bring it to such completeness here,
    without introducing considerations of a wholly different kind, which
    would be perplexing to the reader. On this account I have adopted
    the title of <em>Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals</em>
    instead of that of <em>Critique of Pure Practical Reason</em>.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p12">But in the third place, since a metaphysic of morals, in spite
    of the discouraging title, is yet capable of being presented in popular
    form, and one adapted to the common understanding, I find it useful to
    separate from it this preliminary treatise on its fundamental
    principles, in order that I may not hereafter have need to introduce
    these necessarily subtle discussions into a book of a more simple
    character.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p12">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p13">The present treatise is, however, nothing more than the
    investigation and establishment of the <em>supreme principle of
    morality</em>, and this alone constitutes a study complete in itself and
    one which ought to be kept apart from every other moral investigation.
    No doubt my conclusions on this weighty question, which has hitherto
    been very unsatisfactorily examined, would receive much light from the
    application of the same principle to the whole system, and would be
    greatly confirmed by the adequacy which it exhibits throughout; but
    I must forego this advantage, which indeed would be after all more
    gratifying than useful, since the easy applicability of a principle
    and its apparent adequacy give no very certain proof of its soundness,
    but rather inspire a certain partiality, which prevents us from
    examining and estimating it strictly in itself and without regard to
    consequences.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p13">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p14">I have adopted in this work the method which I think most
    suitable, proceeding analytically from common knowledge to the
    determination of its ultimate principle, and again descending
    synthetically from the examination of this principle and its sources
    to the common knowledge in which we find it employed. The division
    will, therefore, be as follows:
