    <h3>Section One: Transition from the common rational to philosophic moral cognition</h3>

    <p id="p1">Nothing can possibly be conceived in the world, or even out of
    it, which can be called good, without qualification, except a <strong>good
    will</strong>.  Intelligence, wit, judgement, and the other
    <em>talents</em> of the mind, however they may be named, or courage,
    resolution, perseverance, as qualities of <em>temperament</em>, are
    undoubtedly good and desirable in many respects; but these gifts of nature
    may also become extremely bad and mischievous if the will which is to make
    use of them, and which, therefore, constitutes what is called
    <em>character</em>, is not good. It is the same with the <em>gifts of
    fortune</em>. Power, riches, honour, even health, and the general
    well-being and contentment with one&rsquo;s condition which is called
    <em>happiness</em>, inspire pride, and often presumption, if there is not
    a good will to correct the influence of these on the mind, and with this
    also to rectify the whole principle of acting and adapt it to its end. The
    sight of a being who is not adorned with a single feature of a pure and
    good will, enjoying unbroken prosperity, can never give pleasure to an
    impartial rational spectator. Thus a good will appears to constitute the
    indispensable condition even of being worthy of happiness.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>
    
    <p id="p2">There are even some qualities which are of service to this good
    will itself and may facilitate its action, yet which have no intrinsic
    unconditional value, but always presuppose a good will, and this qualifies
    the esteem that we justly have for them and does not permit us to regard
    them as absolutely good. Moderation in the affections and passions,
    self-control, and calm deliberation are not only good in many respects,
    but even seem to constitute part of the <em>intrinsic</em> worth of the
    person; but they are far from deserving to be called good without
    qualification, although they have been so unconditionally praised by the
    ancients. For without the principles of a good will, they may become
    extremely bad, and the coolness of a villain not only makes him far more
    dangerous, but also directly makes him more abominable in our eyes than he
    would have been without it.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p3">A good will is good not because of what it performs or effects,
    not by its aptness for the attainment of some proposed end, but simply
    by virtue of the volition; that is, it is good in itself, and
    considered by itself is to be esteemed much higher than all that can
    be brought about by it in favour of any inclination, nay even of the
    sum total of all inclinations. Even if it should happen that, owing to
    special disfavour of fortune, or the niggardly provision of a
    step-motherly nature, this will should wholly lack power to accomplish
    its purpose, if with its greatest efforts it should yet achieve
    nothing, and there should remain only the good will (not, to be
    sure, a mere wish, but the summoning of all means in our power), then,
    like a jewel, it would still shine by its own light, as a thing
    which has its whole value in itself. Its usefulness or fruitfulness
    can neither add nor take away anything from this value. It would be,
    as it were, only the setting to enable us to handle it the more
    conveniently in common commerce, or to attract to it the attention
    of those who are not yet connoisseurs, but not to recommend it to true
    connoisseurs, or to determine its value.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>
    
    <p id="p4">There is, however, something so strange in this idea of the
    absolute value of the mere will, in which no account is taken of its
    utility, that notwithstanding the thorough assent of even common reason to
    the idea, yet a suspicion must arise that it may perhaps really be the
    product of mere high-flown fancy, and that we may have misunderstood
    the purpose of nature in assigning reason as the governor of our will.
    Therefore we will examine this idea from this point of view.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>
    
    <p id="p5">In the physical constitution of an organized being, that is, a
    being adapted suitably to the purposes of life, we assume it as a
    fundamental principle that no organ for any purpose will be found
    but what is also the fittest and best adapted for that purpose. Now in
    a being which has reason and a will, if the proper object of nature
    were its <em>preservation</em>, its <em>welfare</em>, in a word, its
    <em>happiness</em>, then nature would have hit upon a very bad arrangement
    in selecting the reason of the creature to carry out this purpose. For all
    the actions which the creature has to perform with a view to this purpose,
    and the whole rule of its conduct, would be far more surely prescribed to
    it by instinct, and that end would have been attained thereby much more
    certainly than it ever can be by reason. Should reason have been
    communicated to this favoured creature over and above, it must only have
    served it to contemplate the happy constitution of its nature, to admire
    it, to congratulate itself thereon, and to feel thankful for it to the
    beneficent cause, but not that it should subject its desires to that weak
    and delusive guidance and meddle bunglingly with the purpose of nature. In
    a word, nature would have taken care that reason should not break forth
    into <em>practical use</em>, nor have the presumption, with its weak
    insight, to think out for itself the plan of happiness, and of the means
    of attaining it. Nature would not only have taken on herself the choice of
    the ends, but also of the means, and with wise foresight would have
    entrusted both to instinct.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p6">And, in fact, we find that the more a cultivated reason applies
    itself with deliberate purpose to the enjoyment of life and happiness,
    so much the more does the man fail of true satisfaction. And from this
    circumstance there arises in many, if they are candid enough to
    confess it, a certain degree of <em>misology</em>, that is, hatred of reason,
    especially in the case of those who are most experienced in the use of
    it, because after calculating all the advantages they derive, I do not
    say from the invention of all the arts of common luxury, but even from
    the sciences (which seem to them to be after all only a luxury of
    the understanding), they find that they have, in fact, only brought
    more trouble on their shoulders, rather than gained in happiness;
    and they end by envying, rather than despising, the more common
    stamp of men who keep closer to the guidance of mere instinct and do
    not allow their reason much influence on their conduct. And this we
    must admit, that the judgement of those who would very much lower
    the lofty eulogies of the advantages which reason gives us in regard
    to the happiness and satisfaction of life, or who would even reduce
    them below zero, is by no means morose or ungrateful to the goodness
    with which the world is governed, but that there lies at the root of
    these judgements the idea that our existence has a different and far
    nobler end, for which, and not for happiness, reason is properly
    intended, and which must, therefore, be regarded as the supreme
    condition to which the private ends of man must, for the most part, be
    postponed.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p7">For as reason is not competent to guide the will with certainty in
    regard to its objects and the satisfaction of all our wants (which
    it to some extent even multiplies), this being an end to which an
    implanted instinct would have led with much greater certainty; and
    since, nevertheless, reason is imparted to us as a practical
    faculty, i.e., as one which is to have influence on the <em>will</em>,
    therefore, admitting that nature generally in the distribution of
    her capacities has adapted the means to the end, its true
    destination must be to produce a will, not merely good <em>as a means</em> to
    something else, but <em>good in itself</em>, for which reason was absolutely
    necessary. This will then, though not indeed the sole and complete
    good, must be the supreme good and the condition of every other,
    even of the desire of happiness. Under these circumstances, there is
    nothing inconsistent with the wisdom of nature in the fact that the
    cultivation of the reason, which is requisite for the first and
    unconditional purpose, does in many ways interfere, at least in this
    life, with the attainment of the second, which is always
    conditional, namely, happiness. Nay, it may even reduce it to nothing,
    without nature thereby failing of her purpose. For reason recognizes
    the establishment of a good will as its highest practical destination,
    and in attaining this purpose is capable only of a satisfaction of its
    own proper kind, namely that from the attainment of an end, which
    end again is determined by reason only, notwithstanding that this
    may involve many a disappointment to the ends of inclination.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p8">We have then to develop the notion of a will which deserves to be
    highly esteemed for itself and is good without a view to anything
    further, a notion which exists already in the sound natural
    understanding, requiring rather to be cleared up than to be taught,
    and which in estimating the value of our actions always takes the
    first place and constitutes the condition of all the rest. In order to
    do this, we will take the notion of duty, which includes that of a
    good will, although implying certain subjective restrictions and
    hindrances. These, however, far from concealing it, or rendering it
    unrecognizable, rather bring it out by contrast and make it shine
    forth so much the brighter.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p9">I omit here all actions which are already recognized as inconsistent
    with duty, although they may be useful for this or that purpose, for
    with these the question whether they are done <em>from duty</em> cannot arise
    at all, since they even conflict with it. I also set aside those
    actions which really conform to duty, but to which men have <em>no
    direct inclination</em>, performing them because they are impelled
    thereto by some other inclination. For in this case we can readily
    distinguish whether the action which agrees with duty is done <em>from
    duty</em>, or from a selfish view. It is much harder to make this
    distinction when the action accords with duty and the subject has
    besides a <em>direct</em> inclination to it. For example, it is always a matter
    of duty that a dealer should not over charge an inexperienced
    purchaser; and wherever there is much commerce the prudent tradesman
    does not overcharge, but keeps a fixed price for everyone, so that a
    child buys of him as well as any other. Men are thus <em>honestly</em>
    served; but this is not enough to make us believe that the tradesman
    has so acted from duty and from principles of honesty: his own
    advantage required it; it is out of the question in this case to
    suppose that he might besides have a direct inclination in favour of
    the buyers, so that, as it were, from love he should give no advantage
    to one over another. Accordingly the action was done neither from duty
    nor from direct inclination, but merely with a selfish view.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p10">On the other hand, it is a duty to maintain one&rsquo;s life; and, in
    addition, everyone has also a direct inclination to do so. But on this
    account the of anxious care which most men take for it has no
    intrinsic worth, and their maxim has no moral import. They preserve
    their life <em>as duty requires</em>, no doubt, but not <em>because duty
    requires</em>. On the other band, if adversity and hopeless sorrow have
    completely taken away the relish for life; if the unfortunate one,
    strong in mind, indignant at his fate rather than desponding or
    dejected, wishes for death, and yet preserves his life without
    loving it- not from inclination or fear, but from duty- then his maxim
    has a moral worth.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p11">To be beneficent when we can is a duty; and besides this, there
    are many minds so sympathetically constituted that, without any
    other motive of vanity or self-interest, they find a pleasure in
    spreading joy around them and can take delight in the satisfaction
    of others so far as it is their own work. But I maintain that in
    such a case an action of this kind, however proper, however amiable it
    may be, has nevertheless no true moral worth, but is on a level with
    other inclinations, e.g., the inclination to honour, which, if it is
    happily directed to that which is in fact of public utility and
    accordant with duty and consequently honourable, deserves praise and
    encouragement, but not esteem. For the maxim lacks the moral import,
    namely, that such actions be done <em>from duty</em>, not from inclination. Put
    the case that the mind of that philanthropist were clouded by sorrow
    of his own, extinguishing all sympathy with the lot of others, and
    that, while he still has the power to benefit others in distress, he
    is not touched by their trouble because he is absorbed with his own;
    and now suppose that he tears himself out of this dead
    insensibility, and performs the action without any inclination to
    it, but simply from duty, then first has his action its genuine
    moral worth. Further still; if nature has put little sympathy in the
    heart of this or that man; if he, supposed to be an upright man, is by
    temperament cold and indifferent to the sufferings of others,
    perhaps because in respect of his own he is provided with the
    special gift of patience and fortitude and supposes, or even requires,
    that others should have the same- and such a man would certainly not
    be the meanest product of nature- but if nature had not specially
    framed him for a philanthropist, would he not still find in himself
    a source from whence to give himself a far higher worth than that of a
    good-natured temperament could be? Unquestionably. It is just in
    this that the moral worth of the character is brought out which is
    incomparably the highest of all, namely, that he is beneficent, not
    from inclination, but from duty.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p12">To secure one&rsquo;s own happiness is a duty, at least indirectly; for
    discontent with one&rsquo;s condition, under a pressure of many anxieties
    and amidst unsatisfied wants, might easily become a great <em>temptation
    to transgression of duty</em>. But here again, without looking to duty, all
    men have already the strongest and most intimate inclination to
    happiness, because it is just in this idea that all inclinations are
    combined in one total. But the precept of happiness is often of such a
    sort that it greatly interferes with some inclinations, and yet a
    man cannot form any definite and certain conception of the sum of
    satisfaction of all of them which is called happiness. It is not
    then to be wondered at that a single inclination, definite both as
    to what it promises and as to the time within which it can be
    gratified, is often able to overcome such a fluctuating idea, and that
    a gouty patient, for instance, can choose to enjoy what he likes,
    and to suffer what he may, since, according to his calculation, on
    this occasion at least, he has not sacrificed the enjoyment of the
    present moment to a possibly mistaken expectation of a happiness which
    is supposed to be found in health. But even in this case, if the
    general desire for happiness did not influence his will, and supposing
    that in his particular case health was not a necessary element in this
    calculation, there yet remains in this, as in all other cases, this
    law, namely, that he should promote his happiness not from inclination
    but from duty, and by this would his conduct first acquire true
    moral worth.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p12">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p13">It is in this manner, undoubtedly, that we are to understand those
    passages of Scripture also in which we are commanded to love our
    neighbour, even our enemy. For love, as an affection, cannot be
    commanded, but beneficence for duty&rsquo;s sake may; even though we are not
    impelled to it by any inclination &mdash; nay, are even repelled by a natural
    and unconquerable aversion. This is <em>practical</em> love and not
    <em>pathological</em> &mdash; a love which is seated in the will, and not in the
    propensions of sense, in principles of action and not of tender
    sympathy; and it is this love alone which can be commanded.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p13">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p14">The second proposition is: That an action done from duty derives its
    moral worth, <em>not from the purpose</em> which is to be attained by it, but
    from the maxim by which it is determined, and therefore does not
    depend on the realization of the object of the action, but merely on
    the <em>principle of volition</em> by which the action has taken place, without
    regard to any object of desire. It is clear from what precedes that
    the purposes which we may have in view in our actions, or their
    effects regarded as ends and springs of the will, cannot give to
    actions any unconditional or moral worth. In what, then, can their
    worth lie, if it is not to consist in the will and in reference to its
    expected effect? It cannot lie anywhere but <em>in the principle of the
    will</em> without regard to the ends which can be attained by the action.
    For the will stands between its a priori principle, which is formal,
    and its a posteriori spring, which is material, as between two
    roads, and as it must be determined by something, it that it must be
    determined by the formal principle of volition when an action is
    done from duty, in which case every material principle has been
    withdrawn from it.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p14">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p15">The third proposition, which is a consequence of the two
    preceding, I would express thus: <em>duty is the necessity of acting from
    respect for the law</em>. I may have <em>inclination</em> for an object as the
    effect of my proposed action, but I cannot have <em>respect</em> for it, just
    for this reason, that it is an effect and not an energy of will.
    Similarly I cannot have respect for inclination, whether my own or
    another&rsquo;s; I can at most, if my own, approve it; if another&rsquo;s,
    sometimes even love it; i.e., look on it as favourable to my own
    interest. It is only what is connected with my will as a principle, by
    no means as an effect- what does not subserve my inclination, but
    overpowers it, or at least in case of choice excludes it from its
    calculation- in other words, simply the law of itself, which can be an
    object of respect, and hence a command. Now an action done from duty
    must wholly exclude the influence of inclination and with it every
    object of the will, so that nothing remains which can determine the
    will except objectively the <em>law</em>, and subjectively <em>pure respect</em> for
    this practical law, and consequently the maxim<a class="note" id="cite1" href="#note1">1</a> that I should follow
    this law even to the thwarting of all my inclinations.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p15">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p16">Thus the moral worth of an action does not lie in the effect
    expected from it, nor in any principle of action which requires to
    borrow its motive from this expected effect. For all these effects &ndash;
    agreeableness of one&rsquo;s condition and even the promotion of the
    happiness of others &ndash; could have been also brought about by other
    causes, so that for this there would have been no need of the will
    of a rational being; whereas it is in this alone that the supreme
    and unconditional good can be found. The pre-eminent good which we
    call moral can therefore consist in nothing else than the <em>conception
    of law in itself</em>, which certainly is <em>only possible in a rational
    being</em>, in so far as this conception, and not the expected effect,
    determines the will. This is a good which is already present in the
    person who acts accordingly, and we have not to wait for it to
    appear first in the result<a class="note" id="cite2" href="#note2">2</a>.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p16">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p17">But what sort of law can that be, the conception of which must
    determine the will, even without paying any regard to the effect
    expected from it, in order that this will may be called good
    absolutely and without qualification? As I have deprived the will of
    every impulse which could arise to it from obedience to any law, there
    remains nothing but the universal conformity of its actions to law
    in general, which alone is to serve the will as a principle, i.e., <em>I
    am never to act otherwise than so that I could also will that my maxim
    should become a universal law</em>. Here, now, it is the simple
    conformity to law in general, without assuming any particular law
    applicable to certain actions, that serves the will as its principle
    and must so serve it, if duty is not to be a vain delusion and a
    chimerical notion. The common reason of men in its practical
    judgements perfectly coincides with this and always has in view the
    principle here suggested. Let the question be, for example: May I when
    in distress make a promise with the intention not to keep it? I
    readily distinguish here between the two significations which the
    question may have: Whether it is prudent, or whether it is right, to
    make a false promise? The former may undoubtedly of be the case. I see
    clearly indeed that it is not enough to extricate myself from a
    present difficulty by means of this subterfuge, but it must be well
    considered whether there may not hereafter spring from this lie much
    greater inconvenience than that from which I now free myself, and
    as, with all my supposed <em>cunning</em>, the consequences cannot be so easily
    foreseen but that credit once lost may be much more injurious to me
    than any mischief which I seek to avoid at present, it should be
    considered whether it would not be <em>more prudent</em> to act herein
    according to a universal maxim and to make it a habit to promise
    nothing except with the intention of keeping it. But it is soon
    clear to me that such a maxim will still only be based on the fear
    of consequences. Now it is a wholly different thing to be truthful
    from duty and to be so from apprehension of injurious consequences. In
    the first case, the very notion of the action already implies a law
    for me; in the second case, I must first look about elsewhere to see
    what results may be combined with it which would affect myself. For to
    deviate from the principle of duty is beyond all doubt wicked; but
    to be unfaithful to my maxim of prudence may often be very
    advantageous to me, although to abide by it is certainly safer. The
    shortest way, however, and an unerring one, to discover the answer
    to this question whether a lying promise is consistent with duty, is
    to ask myself, "Should I be content that my maxim (to extricate myself
    from difficulty by a false promise) should hold good as a universal
    law, for myself as well as for others?" and should I be able to say
    to myself, "Every one may make a deceitful promise when he finds
    himself in a difficulty from which he cannot otherwise extricate
    himself?" Then I presently become aware that while I can will the lie,
    I can by no means will that lying should be a universal law. For
    with such a law there would be no promises at all, since it would be
    in vain to allege my intention in regard to my future actions to those
    who would not believe this allegation, or if they over hastily did
    so would pay me back in my own coin. Hence my maxim, as soon as it
    should be made a universal law, would necessarily destroy itself.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p17">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p18">I do not, therefore, need any far-reaching penetration to discern
    what I have to do in order that my will may be morally good.
    Inexperienced in the course of the world, incapable of being
    prepared for all its contingencies, I only ask myself: Canst thou also
    will that thy maxim should be a universal law? If not, then it must be
    rejected, and that not because of a disadvantage accruing from it to
    myself or even to others, but because it cannot enter as a principle
    into a possible universal legislation, and reason extorts from me
    immediate respect for such legislation. I do not indeed as yet discern
    on what this respect is based (this the philosopher may inquire),
    but at least I understand this, that it is an estimation of the
    worth which far outweighs all worth of what is recommended by
    inclination, and that the necessity of acting from <em>pure</em> respect for
    the practical law is what constitutes duty, to which every other
    motive must give place, because it is the condition of a will being
    good <em>in itself</em>, and the worth of such a will is above everything.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p18">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p19">Thus, then, without quitting the moral knowledge of common human
    reason, we have arrived at its principle. And although, no doubt,
    common men do not conceive it in such an abstract and universal
    form, yet they always have it really before their eyes and use it as
    the standard of their decision. Here it would be easy to show how,
    with this compass in hand, men are well able to distinguish, in
    every case that occurs, what is good, what bad, conformably to duty or
    inconsistent with it, if, without in the least teaching them
    anything new, we only, like Socrates, direct their attention to the
    principle they themselves employ; and that, therefore, we do not
    need science and philosophy to know what we should do to be honest and
    good, yea, even wise and virtuous. Indeed we might well have
    conjectured beforehand that the knowledge of what every man is bound
    to do, and therefore also to know, would be within the reach of
    every man, even the commonest. Here we cannot forbear admiration
    when we see how great an advantage the practical judgement has over
    the theoretical in the common understanding of men. In the latter,
    if common reason ventures to depart from the laws of experience and
    from the perceptions of the senses, it falls into mere
    inconceivabilities and self-contradictions, at least into a chaos of
    uncertainty, obscurity, and instability. But in the practical sphere
    it is just when the common understanding excludes all sensible springs
    from practical laws that its power of judgement begins to show
    itself to advantage. It then becomes even subtle, whether it be that
    it chicanes with its own conscience or with other claims respecting
    what is to be called right, or whether it desires for its own
    instruction to determine honestly the worth of actions; and, in the
    latter case, it may even have as good a hope of hitting the mark as
    any philosopher whatever can promise himself. Nay, it is almost more
    sure of doing so, because the philosopher cannot have any other
    principle, while he may easily perplex his judgement by a multitude of
    considerations foreign to the matter, and so turn aside from the right
    way. Would it not therefore be wiser in moral concerns to acquiesce in
    the judgement of common reason, or at most only to call in
    philosophy for the purpose of rendering the system of morals more
    complete and intelligible, and its rules more convenient for use
    (especially for disputation), but not so as to draw off the common
    understanding from its happy simplicity, or to bring it by means of
    philosophy into a new path of inquiry and instruction?

    <p id="p20">Innocence is indeed a glorious thing; only, on the other hand, it is
    very sad that it cannot well maintain itself and is easily seduced. On
    this account even wisdom- which otherwise consists more in conduct
    than in knowledge- yet has need of science, not in order to learn from
    it, but to secure for its precepts admission and permanence. Against
    all the commands of duty which reason represents to man as so
    deserving of respect, he feels in himself a powerful counterpoise in
    his wants and inclinations, the entire satisfaction of which he sums
    up under the name of happiness. Now reason issues its commands
    unyieldingly, without promising anything to the inclinations, and,
    as it were, with disregard and contempt for these claims, which are so
    impetuous, and at the same time so plausible, and which will not allow
    themselves to be suppressed by any command. Hence there arises a
    <em>natural dialectic</em>, i.e., a disposition, to argue against these
    strict laws of duty and to question their validity, or at least
    their purity and strictness; and, if possible, to make them more
    accordant with our wishes and inclinations, that is to say, to corrupt
    them at their very source, and entirely to destroy their worth &ndash; a
    thing which even common practical reason cannot ultimately call good.

    <p id="p21">Thus is the <em>common reason of man</em> compelled to go out of its
    sphere, and to take a step into the field of a <em>practical philosophy</em>,
    not to satisfy any speculative want (which never occurs to it as
    long as it is content to be mere sound reason), but even on
    practical grounds, in order to attain in it information and clear
    instruction respecting the source of its principle, and the correct
    determination of it in opposition to the maxims which are based on
    wants and inclinations, so that it may escape from the perplexity of
    opposite claims and not run the risk of losing all genuine moral
    principles through the equivocation into which it easily falls.
    Thus, when practical reason cultivates itself, there insensibly arises
    in it a <em>dialectic</em> which forces it to seek aid in philosophy, just as
    happens to it in its theoretic use; and in this case, therefore, as
    well as in the other, it will find rest nowhere but in a thorough
    critical examination of our reason.

        A maxim is the subjective principle of volition. The objective
        principle (i.e., that which would also serve subjectively as a
        practical principle to all rational beings if reason had full power
        over the faculty of desire) is the practical law.

        It might be here objected to me that I take refuge behind the
        word respect in an obscure feeling, instead of giving a distinct
        solution of the question by a concept of the reason. But although
        respect is a feeling, it is not a feeling received through
        influence, but is self-wrought by a rational concept, and,
        therefore, is specifically distinct from all feelings of the former
        kind, which may be referred either to inclination or fear.  What I
        recognise immediately as a law for me, I recognise with respect.
        This merely signifies the consciousness that my will is subordinate to
        a law, without the intervention of other influences on my sense. The
        immediate determination of the will by the law, and the
        consciousness of this, is called respect, so that this is regarded
        as an effect of the law on the subject, and not as the cause of it.
        Respect is properly the conception of a worth which thwarts my
        self-love. Accordingly it is something which is considered neither
        as an object of inclination nor of fear, although it has something
        analogous to both. The object of respect is the law only, and that the
        law which we impose on ourselves and yet recognise as necessary in
        itself. As a law, we are subjected too it without consulting
        self-love; as imposed by us on ourselves, it is a result of our
        will. In the former aspect it has an analogy to fear, in the latter to
        inclination. Respect for a person is properly only respect for the law
        (of honesty, etc.) of which he gives us an example. Since we also look
        on the improvement of our talents as a duty, we consider that we see
        in a person of talents, as it were, the example of a law (viz., to
        become like him in this by exercise), and this constitutes our
        respect. All so-called moral interest consists simply in respect for
        the law.
