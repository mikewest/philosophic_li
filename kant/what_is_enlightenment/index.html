  <h2><address class="author vcard"><span class="fn">Immanuel Kant</span></h2>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p id="p1"><strong><em>Enlightenment</em> is man&#8217;s emergence from his
    self-imposed immaturity.</strong> <strong>Immaturity</strong> is the
    inability to use one&#8217;s understanding without guidance from another.
    This immaturity is <strong>self-imposed</strong> when its cause lies not
    in lack of understanding, but in lack of resolve and courage to use it
    without guidance from another. <em>Sapere Aude!</em><a class="note"
    id="cite1" href="#note1">1</a> &#8220;Have courage to use <strong>your
    own</strong> understanding!&#8221; &#8212; that is the motto of
    enlightenment.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p2">Laziness and cowardice are the reasons why so great a proportion of
    men, long after nature has released them from alien guidance (<span
    class="translation" lang="la">naturaliter maiorennes</span>), nonetheless
    gladly remain in lifelong immaturity, and why it is so easy for others to
    establish themselves as their guardians. It is so easy to be immature. If
    I have a book to serve as my understanding, a pastor to serve as my
    conscience, a physician to determine my diet for me, and so on, I need not
    exert myself at all. I need not think, if only I can pay: others will
    readily undertake the irksome work for me. The guardians who have so
    benevolently taken over the supervision of men have carefully seen to it
    that the far greatest part of them (including the entire fair sex) regard
    taking the step to maturity as very dangerous, not to mention difficult.
    Having first made their domestic livestock dumb, and having carefully made
    sure that these docile creatures will not take a single step without the
    go-cart to which they are harnessed, these guardians then show them the
    danger that threatens them, should they attempt to walk alone. Now this
    danger is not actually so great, for after falling a few times they would
    in the end certainly learn to walk; but an example of this kind makes men
    timid and usually frightens them out of all further attempts.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p3">Thus, it is difficult for any individual man to work himself out of the
    immaturity that has all but become his nature. He has even become fond of
    this state and for the time being is actually incapable of using his own
    understanding, for no one has ever allowed him to attempt it. Rules and
    formulas, those mechanical aids to the rational use, or rather misuse, of
    his natural gifts, are the shackles of a permanent immaturity. Whoever
    threw them off would still make only an uncertain leap over the smallest
    ditch, since he is unaccustomed to this kind of free movement.
    Consequently, only a few have succeeded, by cultivating their own minds,
    in freeing themselves from immaturity and pursuing a secure course.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p4">But that the public should enlighten itself is more likely; indeed, if
    it is only allowed freedom, enlightenment is almost inevitable. For even
    among the entrenched guardians of the great masses a few will always think
    for themselves, a few who, after having themselves thrown off the yoke of
    immaturity, will spread the spirit of a rational appreciation for both
    their own worth and for each person&#8217;s calling to think for himself.
    But it should be particularly noted that if a public that was first placed
    in this yoke by the guardians is suitably aroused by some of those who are
    altogether incapable of enlightenment, it may force the guardians
    themselves to remain under the yoke&#8212;so pernicious is it to instill
    prejudices, for they finally take revenge upon their originators, or on
    their descendants. Thus a public can only attain enlightenment slowly.
    Perhaps a revolution can overthrow autocratic despotism and profiteering
    or power-grabbing oppression, but it can never truly reform a manner of
    thinking; instead, new prejudices, just like the old ones they replace,
    will serve as a leash for the great unthinking mass.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p5">Nothing is required for this enlightenment, however, except
    <strong>freedom</strong>; and the freedom in question is the least harmful
    of all, namely, the freedom to use reason <strong>publicly</strong> in all
    matters. But on all sides I hear: &#8220;<strong>Do not
    argue!</strong>&#8221; The officer says, &#8220;Do not argue, drill!&#8221;
    The tax man says, &#8220;Do not argue, pay!&#8221; The pastor says, &#8220;
    Do not argue, believe!&#8221; (Only one ruler in the World says,
    &#8220;<strong>Argue</strong> as much as you want and about what you want,
    <strong>but obey</strong>!&#8221;) In this we have examples of pervasive
    restrictions on freedom. But which restriction hinders enlightenment and
    which does not, but instead actually advances it? I reply: The
    <strong>public</strong> use of one&#8217;s reason must always be free, and
    it alone can bring about enlightenment among mankind; the
    <strong>private</strong> use of reason may, however, often be very
    narrowly restricted, without otherwise hindering the progress of
    enlightenment. By the public use of one&#8217;s own reason I understand
    the use that anyone <strong><em>as</em> <em>a</em>
    <em>scholar</em></strong> makes of reason before the entire
    <strong>literate world</strong>. I call the private use of reason that
    which a person may make in a <strong>civic post</strong> or office that
    has been entrusted to him. Now in many affairs conducted in the interests
    of a community, a certain mechanism is required by means of which some of
    its members must conduct themselves in an entirely passive manner so that
    through an artificial unanimity the government may guide them toward
    public ends, or at least prevent them from destroying such ends. Here one
    certainly must not argue, instead one must obey. However, insofar as this
    part of the machine also regards himself as a member of the community as a
    whole, or even of the world community, and as a consequence addresses the
    public in the role of a scholar, in the proper sense of that term, he can
    most certainly argue, without thereby harming the affairs for which as a
    passive member he is partly responsible. Thus it would be disastrous if an
    officer on duty who was given a command by his superior were to question
    the appropriateness or utility of the order. He must obey. But as a
    scholar he cannot be justly constrained from making comments about errors
    in military service, or from placing them before the public for its
    judgment. The citizen cannot refuse to pay the taxes imposed on him;
    indeed, impertinent criticism of such levies, when they should be paid by
    him, can be punished as a scandal (since it can lead to widespread
    insubordination). But the same person does not act contrary to civic duty
    when, as a scholar, he publicly expresses his thoughts regarding the
    impropriety or even injustice of such taxes. Likewise a pastor is bound to
    instruct his catecumens and congregation in accordance with the symbol of
    the church he serves, for he was appointed on that condition. But as a
    scholar he has complete freedom, indeed even the calling, to impart to the
    public all of his carefully considered and well-intentioned thoughts
    concerning mistaken aspects of that symbol, as well as his suggestions for
    the better arrangement of religious and church matters. Nothing in this
    can weigh on his conscience. What he teaches in consequence of his office
    as a servant of the church he sets out as something with regard to which
    he has no discretion to teach in accord with his own lights; rather, he
    offers it under the direction and in the name of another. He will say,
    &#8220;Our church teaches this or that and these are the demonstrations it
    uses.&#8221; He thereby extracts for his congregation all practical uses
    from precepts to which he would not himself subscribe with complete
    conviction, but whose presentation he can nonetheless undertake, since it
    is not entirely impossible that truth lies hidden in them, and, in any
    case, nothing contrary to the very nature of religion is to be found in
    them. If he believed he could find anything of the latter sort in them, he
    could not in good conscience serve in his position; he would have to
    resign. Thus an appointed teacher&#8217;s use of his reason for the sake
    of his congregation is merely <strong>private</strong>, because, however
    large the congregation is, this use is always only domestic; in this
    regard, as a priest, he is not free and cannot be such because he is
    acting under instructions from someone else. By contrast, the
    cleric&#8212; as a scholar who speaks through his writings to the public
    as such, i.e., the world&#8212;enjoys in this <strong>public use</strong>
    of reason an unrestricted freedom to use his own rational capacities and
    to speak his own mind. For that the (spiritual) guardians of a people
    should themselves be immature is an absurdity that would insure the
    perpetuation of absurdities.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p6">But would a society of pastors, perhaps a church assembly or venerable
    presbytery (as those among the Dutch call themselves), not be justified in
    binding itself by oath to a certain unalterable symbol in order to secure
    a constant guardianship over each of its members and through them over the
    people, and this for all time: I say that this is wholly impossible. Such
    a contract, whose intention is to preclude forever all further
    enlightenment of the human race, is absolutely null and void, even if it
    should be ratified by the supreme power, by parliaments, and by the most
    solemn peace treaties. One age cannot bind itself, and thus conspire, to
    place a succeeding one in a condition whereby it would be impossible for
    the later age to expand its knowledge (particularly where it is so very
    important), to rid itself of errors,and generally to increase its
    enlightenment. That would be a crime against human nature, whose essential
    destiny lies precisely in such progress; subsequent generations are thus
    completely justified in dismissing such agreements as unauthorized and
    criminal. The criterion of everything that can be agreed upon as a law by
    a people lies in this question: Can a people impose such a law on itself?
    Now it might be possible, in anticipation of a better state of affairs, to
    introduce a provisional order for a specific, short time, all the while
    giving all citizens, especially clergy, in their role as scholars, the
    freedom to comment publicly, i.e., in writing, on the present
    institution&#8217;s shortcomings. The provisional order might last until
    insight into the nature of these matters had become so widespread and
    obvious that the combined (if not unanimous) voices of the populace could
    propose to the crown that it take under its protection those congregations
    that, in accord with their newly gained insight, had organized themselves
    under altered religious institutions, but without interfering with those
    wishing to allow matters to remain as before. However, it is absolutely
    forbidden that they unite into a religious organization that nobody may
    for the duration of a man&#8217;s lifetime publicly question, for so doing
    would deny, render fruitless, and make detrimental to succeeding
    generations an era in man&#8217;s progress toward improvement. A man may
    put off enlightenment with regard to what he ought to know, though only
    for a short time and for his own person; but to renounce it for himself,
    or, even more, for subsequent generations, is to violate and trample
    man&#8217;s divine rights underfoot. And what a people may not decree for
    itself may still less be imposed on it by a monarch, for his lawgiving
    authority rests on his unification of the people&#8217;s collective will
    in his own. If he only sees to it that all genuine or purported
    improvement is consonant with civil order, he can allow his subjects to do
    what they find necessary to their spiritual well-being, which is not his
    affair. However, he must prevent anyone from forcibly interfering with
    another&#8217;s working as best he can to determine and promote his
    well-being. It detracts from his own majesty when he interferes in these
    matters, since the writings in which his subjects attempt to clarify their
    insights lend value to his conception of governance. This holds whether he
    acts from his own highest insight&#8212;whereby he calls upon himself the
    reproach, &#8220;<span class="translation" lang="la">Caesar non est supra
    grammaticos.</span>&#8221;<a class="note" id="cite2"
    href="#note2">2</a> &#8212; as well as, indeed even more, when
    he despoils his highest authority by supporting the spiritual despotism of
    some tyrants in his state over his other subjects.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p7">If it is now asked, &#8220;Do we presently live in an
    <strong>enlightened age</strong>?&#8221; the answer is, &#8220;No, but we
    do live in an age of <strong>enlightenment</strong>.&#8221; As matters now
    stand, a great deal is still lacking in order for men as a whole to be, or
    even to put themselves into a position to be able without external
    guidance to apply understanding confidently to religious issues. But we do
    have clear indications that the way is now being opened for men to proceed
    freely in this direction and that the obstacles to general
    enlightenment&#8212;to their release from their self-imposed
    immaturity&#8212;are gradually diminishing. In this regard, this age is
    the age of enlightenment, the century of
    <strong><em>Frederick</em></strong><a class="note" id="cite3"
    href="#note3">3</a>.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p8">A prince who does not find it beneath him to say that he takes it to be
    his <strong>duty</strong> to prescribe nothing, but rather to allow men
    complete freedom in religious matters&#8212;who thereby renounces the
    arrogant title of tolerance&#8212;is himself enlightened and deserves to
    be praised by a grateful present and by posterity as the first, at least
    where the government is concerned, to release the human race from
    immaturity and to leave everyone free to use his own reason in all matters
    of conscience. Under his rule, venerable pastors, in their role as
    scholars and without prejudice to their official duties, may freely and
    openly set out for the world&#8217;s scrutiny their judgments and views,
    even where these occasionally differ from the accepted symbol. Still
    greater freedom is afforded to those who are not restricted by an official
    post. This spirit of freedom is expanding even where it must struggle
    against the external obstacles of governments that misunderstand their own
    function. Such governments are illuminated by the example that the
    existence of freedom need not give cause for the least concern regarding
    public order and harmony in the commonwealth. If only they refrain from
    inventing artifices to keep themselves in it, men will gradually raise
    themselves from barbarism.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p9">I have focused on <strong>religious matters</strong> in setting out my
    main point concerning enlightenment, i.e., man&#8217;s emergence from
    self-imposed immaturity, first because our rulers have no interest in
    assuming the role of their subjects&#8217; guardians with respect to the
    arts and sciences, and secondly because that form of immaturity is both
    the most pernicious and disgraceful of all. But the manner of thinking of
    a head of state who favors religious enlightenment goes even further, for
    he realizes that there is no danger to his <strong>legislation</strong> in
    allowing his subjects to use reason publicly and to set before the world
    their thoughts concerning better formulations of his laws, even if this
    involves frank criticism of legislation currently in effect. We have
    before us a shining example, with respect to which no monarch surpasses
    the one whom we honor.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p10">But only a ruler who is himself enlightened and has no dread of
    shadows, yet who likewise has a well-disciplined, numerous army to
    guarantee public peace, can say what no republic may dare, namely:
    &#8220;<strong>Argue as much as you want and about what you want, but
    obey!</strong>&#8221; Here as elsewhere, when things are considered in
    broad perspective, a strange, unexpected pattern in human affairs reveals
    itself, one in which almost everything is paradoxical. A greater degree of
    civil freedom seems advantageous to a people&#8217;s
    <strong>spiritual</strong> freedom; yet the former established impassable
    boundaries for the latter; conversely, a lesser degree of civil freedom
    provides enough room for all fully to expand their abilities. Thus, once
    nature has removed the hard shell from this kernel for which she has most
    fondly cared, namely, the inclination to and vocation for <strong>free
    thinking</strong>, the kernel gradually reacts on a people&#8217;s
    mentality (whereby they become increasingly able to <strong>act
    freely</strong>), and it finally even influences the principles of
    government, which finds that it can profit by treating men, who are now
    more than machines, in accord with their dignity.
